NOTE: This document will be updated with more detail in the near future.
For this assignment I'm going to try and create a card matching game. I'm going to
attempt it using a single activity and multiple fragments (title screen and game screen).

Personal Project Goals:
-Take it slow
-Refactor often
-Commit milestones often and clearly
-Be proactive and build in debugging and use of logcat.
